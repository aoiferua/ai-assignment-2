### What is this repository for? ###

Algorithmic trading is the process of using computer program to follow a defined set of rules for
placing a trade in order to generate profits at a speed and frequency that is impossible for a human
trader. The rules are usually designed manually based on different strategies, e.g., momentum based,
mean-reverting, trend following, market-neutral, and directional. The rules can also be derived by
sophisticated statistical or machine learning techniques.

In this project I have an opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to algorithmic trading.
I will gain an insight into algorithmic trading as well as valuable hands-on experience in machine
learning and Python.
